# Designing-a-Full-Adder-Using-Spintronics-Devices


# Introduction:
The rapid advancement of computing systems has generated interest in new technologies that offer higher speed, lower power consumption, and improved scaling compared to traditional CMOS technology. One such promising approach is the use of spintronics (spin-based electronics), which exploits the spin of electrons, in addition to their charge, to perform logical operations. Spintronics devices, including magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) and spin transistors, have been explored for non-volatile memory and logic circuits. In this report, we will explore the theory behind designing a full adder using spintronics devices.

## Spintronics Basics:
Spintronics relies on the manipulation of the electron's spin (up or down) in addition to its charge. The two key phenomena used in spintronics devices are:
1. Spin Polarization: Electrons in ferromagnetic materials have spins aligned in a particular direction. Spin polarization refers to the generation of an electron current with a majority of spins oriented in a specific direction (up or down).
2. Magnetoresistance: This is the property of a material to change its electrical resistance depending on the relative orientation of the spins in different regions of the device. The most commonly used effect in spintronics is Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR), which occurs in Magnetic Tunnel Junctions (MTJs).

## Magnetic Tunnel Junction (MTJ):
Magnetic tunnel junction MTJ is the fundamental element in the spintronics domain. In MTJ, two ferromagnetic layers have been present, of which one layer has a fixed magnetic. The free layer(FL) magnetization alignment can be adjusted in an anti-parallel (RAP) or parallel(RP) configuration relative to a fixed layer. A tunnel oxide barrier separates both layers. The basic principle in MTJ is the Tunnel Magnetoresistance (TMR) effect.
